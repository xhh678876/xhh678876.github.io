# 💻 Experience

- 2025.04 - present, ScaleLab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Advisor: Yao Mark Mu
- 2025.07 - 2025.08, Zhejiang Lingqiao Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., AI & Embedded Systems Intern
- 2025.09 - 2026.01, Speech Processing Lab, National Taiwan University, Advisor: Hung-yi Lee
  - Fine-tuned large-scale Taiwanese speech–language models using the DeSTA2.5 framework, integrating Llama3-8B as the text backbone and Whisper-v3 as the acoustic encoder. Implemented LoRA-based alignment and timestamp-aware fine-tuning to enhance accent adaptation and improve ASR robustness across diverse regional dialects.
  - Designed and optimized a full multi-GPU training and evaluation pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, LoRA parameter-efficient training, and distributed evaluation across speech benchmarks such as TAU-TW Benchmark. Achieved a relative improvement of over 8–10% in recognition accuracy compared to baseline models.
  - Developed and experimented with speech–language alignment strategies that combine contrastive loss and multi-level feature fusion, enabling the model to perform cross-lingual reasoning and contextually grounded transcription under complex acoustic variations (e.g., Taiwanese Mandarin, Hokkien, and mixed-accent speech).
